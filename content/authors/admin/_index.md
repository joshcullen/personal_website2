I am a postdoc fellow in [Mariana Fuentes' lab](https://marianafuentes.net/) developing a transferable species distribution modeling approach. This includes the integration of different sources of species occurrence data (e.g., sightings, telemetry), accounting for habitat preferences of different age classes (e.g., juveniles, adults), and using species' physiology (e.g., thermal tolerance) to inform habitat suitability. In general, my research takes an integrative approach to understand how animals interact with their environment.

My previous work has included the use of different types of data (morphological, performance, diet, toxicology, movement) to model resource use within a single species, how this may change as it gets older/larger, and how this compares against potential competitors. By incorporating multiple lines of evidence, we can develop a more complete understanding of an animal's ecology and predict how it will respond to anthropogenic pressure and climate change. Additionally, I have developed a set of non-parametric Bayesian models to estimate latent behavioral states from animal movement data, which are included within the [bayesmove](https://joshcullen.github.io/bayesmove) R package.
